                    <p data-trans>
                        Lion & Lion Digital Group today announces the launch of its Chinese New Year Give-Back Store ‘GongXiRezeki’ shop on Carousell to raise funds for frontliners this Chinese New Year. All proceeds collected will go to Sumbangan Perubatan KKM. Employees of the agency have come together to donate their pre-loved goods in this e-Commerce Store, for a good cause. The campaign will be running live till the end of February and all profits garnered will be donated to meet the needs of frontliners, as a thankful gesture for their ongoing support throughout COVID-19.
                        <br><br>
                        Chinese New Year is a time for family reunions and sharing of joy. The initiative is launched with the intention of extending the joy to our frontlines who continue to relentlessly battle the virus and selflessly work towards our care and protection. Keeping creativity at the heart of everything, Lion & Lion has rolled out this digital campaign to make an impactful difference in the community. With this initiative, the organization also gives everyone an opportunity to come together and contribute towards something good.
                        <br><br>
                        Cheelip Ong, Regional Chief Creative Officer adds on, “As an agency, we are focused on delivering impact and doing the right thing, with creativity as our core. It is an honour to be able to work on this CSR Initiative with my teammates to use a fresh solution in the form of an e-Commerce Give Back store to raise funds for our frontliners.”
                        <br><br>
                        Adding to this, Ben Chew, Managing Director of Lion & Lion Malaysia says, “To all the extraordinary people who have given so much and so selflessly, we hope you will accept the Lion’s Share as our tribute and gratitude for having kept Malaysia safe, up and going thus far. ”

                    <br>
                    Lion & Lion needs to gather and use certain information about individuals.</p>

                <p>These can include customers, suppliers, business contacts, employees and other people the organisation has a relationship with or may need to contact.</p>

                <p>This policy describes how personal data must be collected, handled and stored to meet the company’s data protection standards — and to comply with the laws.</p>

                <p>Lion & Lion may change, revise and/or amend this policy from time to time in accordance with the relevant laws. The updated version of such changes will be effective starting from the date that it is published.</p>

                <p>
                    <strong class="l-text-uppercase">Why this policy exists</strong><br>
                    This data protection policy ensures Lion & Lion:
                </p>
                <p>
                    • Complies with data protection laws and follows good practice
                    <br>
                    • Protects the rights of staff, customers and partners
                    <br>
                    • Is open about how it stores and processes individuals’ data
                    <br>
                    • Protects itself from the risks of a data breach
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong class="l-text-uppercase">Data protection law</strong>
                    <br>
                    Data Protection Law, in general, governs how organisations,  including Lion & Lion, must collect, handle and store personal information.
                </p>

                <p>Data Protection Law applies regardless of whether data is stored electronically, on paper or on other materials. To comply with the law, personal information must be collected and used fairly, stored safely and not disclosed unlawfully. </p>

                <p>
                    Each of the entities under the Lion & Lion Group adheres to its local data protection law (if any); namely;
                    <br>
                    • Malaysia – Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA)
                    <br>
                    • HK – Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486)
                    <br>
                    • Singapore – Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012)
                    <br>
                    • Vietnam – Law on Cyber-Information Security (LCIS)
                    <br>
                    • Taiwan – Personal Data Protection Law (‘PDPL’)
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p>In addition, Lion & Lion Group will also adhere to the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) when applicable (ie. when personal data is processed for activities and transactions occur within the European Union). </p>

                <p>
                    The General Data Protection Regulations are underpinned by six important principles. These say that personal data must:
                    <br>
                    • Be processed fairly and lawfully and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals;
                    <br>
                    • Be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes;
                    <br>
                    • Be adequate, relevant and not excessive
                    <br>
                    • Be accurate and kept up to date
                    <br>
                    • Not be held for any longer than necessary
                    <br>
                    • Be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects and in a manner ensuring appropriate security of the personal data
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong class="l-text-uppercase">Policy scope</strong>
                    <br>
                    This policy applies to:

                    • All staff of Lion & Lion
                    <br>

                    • Any related and affiliated companies of Lion & Lion (including Lion & Lion’s intermediate owners and ultimate beneficial owner)
                </p>

                <p>
                    It applies to all data that the company holds relating to identifiable individuals. This can include:
                    <br>
                    • Names of individuals
                    <br>

                    <strong class="l-text-uppercase">Data protection risks</strong>
                    <br>
                    This policy helps to protect Lion & Lion from some data security risks, including:
                    <br>
                    • Breaches of confidentiality. For instance, information being given out inappropriately.
                    <br>

                    • Lion & Lion will also conduct a Risk Management Plan to assess risk  and mitigate harm to the data that is collected and stored. This Risk Management Plan,
                    created by the Project Manager of any project, defines how risks associated with any project will be identified, analyzed and managed and such plan will outline
                    how risk management activities will be performed, recorded and monitored throughout the lifecycle of the project.

                    • A visible and easy to use mechanism will always be provided to individuals to withdraw their consent for processing their personal data.
                    <br>
                    • When working with personal data, employees should ensure the screens of their computers are always locked when left unattended.

                    • Personal data processed within the EU (if any) should never be transferred to a country or territory outside of the European Economic Area unless the country
                    or territory ensures adequate level of security and unless there is a written consent.
                    <br>  
                    • Employees should not save copies of personal data to their own computers. Always access and update the central copy of any data.
                    <br>
                    • Privacy / data protection compliance should always be taken into consideration in the:

                </p>

                <p>These guidelines also apply to data that is usually stored electronically but has been printed out for some reason:</p>

                <p>
                    • When not required, the paper or files should be kept in a locked drawer or filing cabinet.
                    <br>
                    • Employees should make sure paper and printouts are not left where unauthorised people could see them, like on a printer.
                    <br>
                    • Data printouts should be shredded and disposed of securely when no longer required.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    When data is stored electronically, it must be protected from unauthorised access, accidental deletion and malicious hacking attempts:
                    <br>
                    • Data should be protected by strong passwords that are changed regularly and never shared between employees.
                    <br>
                    • If data is stored on removable media (like a CD or DVD), these should be kept locked away securely when not being used.
                    <br>
                    • Data should only be stored on designated drives and servers, and should only be uploaded to an approved cloud computing services.

                    <br>
                    • Data should be backed up frequently. Those backups should be tested regularly, in line with the company’s standard backup procedures.

                    <br>
                    • All servers and computers containing data should be protected by approved security software and a firewall.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Data deletion or transfer requests should be made by email, addressed to the data controller at gdpr@lionandlion.com. The data controller will supply a standard request form and will aim to address the request within 14 days.
                    <br>

                    The applicable laws require Lion & Lion to take reasonable steps to ensure data is kept accurate and up to date.
                </p>

                <p>The more important it is that the personal data is accurate, the greater the effort Lion & Lion should put into ensuring its accuracy.</p>

                <p>
                    It is the responsibility of all employees who work with data to take reasonable steps to ensure it is kept as accurate and up to date as possible.
                    <br>
                    • Data will be held in as few places as necessary. Staff should not create any unnecessary additional data sets.
                    <br>
                    • Staff should take every opportunity to ensure data is updated. For instance, by confirming a customer’s details when they call.
                    <br>
                    • Data should be updated as inaccuracies are discovered. For instance, if a customer can no longer be reached on their stored telephone number, it should be
                    removed from the database.
                    <br>
                    • It is the marketing manager’s responsibility to ensure marketing databases are checked against industry suppression files every six months and to record the
                    status after each check.
